### Neuron Doctrine

+ The neuron is the fundamental structural & functional unit of the brain.

+ Neurons are discrete cells and not continuous with other cells.

+ Information flows from the _dendrites_ to the _axon_ via the cell body (_soma_).

### Idealized Neuron

An idealized neuron is showed as following:

A neuron is nothing but a "leaky bag of charged liquid". Contents of the neuron enclosed within a _cell membrane_. Cell membrane is a _lipid_ bilayer that is _impermeable_ to charged ion species such as \\(\text{Na}^{+}\\), \\(\text{Cl}^{-}\\), \\(\text{K}^{+}\\). _Ionic channels_ embedded in membrane allow ions to flow in or out.

### Ionic Channels

Each neuron maintains a _potential difference_ across its membrane. Typically, inside is about \\(-70 mV\\) relative to outside. The difference is that \\(\text{Na}^{+}\\) and \\(\text{Cl}^{-}\\) are higher outside; \\(\text{K}^{+}\\) and \\(\text{A}^{-}\\) are higher inside. _Ionic pump_ maintains \\(-70 mV\\) difference by expelling \\(\text{Na}^{+}\\) out and allowing \\(\text{K}^{+}\\) in.

Ionic channels in membranes are proteins that are _selective_ and allow _only specific ions_ to pass through. For example, one ionic channel may only pass \\(\text{Na}^{+}\\) but not \\(\text{K}^{+}\\) or \\(\text{Cl}^{-}\\). Ionic channels are _gated_, and there are typically 3 types of gated ionic channels:

+ __Voltage-gated__: probability of opening depends on membrane voltage.

+ __Chemically-gated__: Binding to a chemical causes to open.

+ __Mechanically-gated__: Sensitive to pressure or stretch.

Gated channels allow neuronal signaling. Inputs from other neurons causes _chemically-gated channels_ open and then changes in local membrane potential is occurred.

This in turn causes opening/closing of _voltage-gated channels_ in dendrites, body and axon, resulting _depolarization_ (positive change in voltage) or _hyperpolarization_ (negative change in voltage). Strong depolarization causes a spike or "action potential".

### Action Potential

Voltage-gated channels causes _action potentials_. Strong depolarization open \\(\text{Na}^{+}\\) channels, causing rapid \\(\text{Na}^{+}\\) _influx_ and more channels to open, until they inactivate. \\(\text{K}^{+}\\) _outflux_ restores membrane potential then.

The spike propagates along the axon.

Myelin due to oligodendrocytes (glial cells) wrap axons and enable _fast long-range spike communication_. Action potential "hops" from one non-myelinated region (node of ranvier) to the next (_saltatory conduction_). This "active wire" allows _lossless signal propagation_.

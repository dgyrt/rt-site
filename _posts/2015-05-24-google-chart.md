I was looking for a way of drawing family tree in HTML. Then I was suggested to have a look on Google Charts. Oh, my, it's AWESOME. So I decided to develop a tutorial on plotting with Google Chart. By the way, I'm new to JavaScript. So I might make mistakes here and there. But it will definitely work.

Actually, you can find many useful examples in [Google Charts documentation](https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/index). So here I will emphasize on plotting with CSV file.

<select id="range"></select>
<select id="domain"></select>

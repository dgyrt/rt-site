This page is to maintain a model pool for sharing deep learning __pre-trained__ models that are written in Theano and Torch primarily.

The basic idea of this page is inspired by [Caffe's Model Zoo](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo) where they collected many pre-trained image recognition models for speeding up future research.

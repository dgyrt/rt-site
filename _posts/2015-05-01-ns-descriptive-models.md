Descriptive models summarize large amounts of experimental data compactly yet accurately, thereby characterizing what neurons and neural circuits do.

### Descriptive Model of Receptive Field

> Definition: _Specific properties_ of a sensory stimulus that generate a strong respond from the cell.

+ Spot of light that turns on a particular location on a retina

+ Bar of light that turns on a particular orientation and location on the retina

Receptive fields in the retina are center-surround receptive fields in the retina, it either a _on-center off-surround receptive field_ or _off-center on-surround receptive field_.

Retina passes the information to _Primary Visual Cortex (V1)_ through _Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN)_. And V1 responds to _oriented receptive field_

### Peripheral Nervous System (PNS)

#### Somatic Nervous System

> Nerves connecting to voluntary _skeletal muscles_ and _sensory receptors_.

There are two types of nerve fibers that carries information:

+ _Afferent Nerve Fibers (incoming)_: Axons that carry info away from _periphery_ to the _CNS_.

+ _Efferent Nerve Fibers (outgoing)_: Axons that carry info from the _CNS_ outward to the _periphery_.

#### Automatic Nervous System

> Nerves connecting to the heart, blood vessels, smooth muscles, and glands.

### Central Nervous System (CNS)

#### Spinal Cord

+ _Local feedback loops_: control reflexes ("reflex arcs");

+ _Descending motor control signals_ from the _brain_ active spinal motor neurons.

+ _Ascending sensory axons_ convey sensory information from muscles and skin back to the _brain.

#### Brain

+ The _Hindbrain_:
  + _Medulla Oblongata_: controls breathing, muscle tone and blood pressure.
  + _Pons_: Connected to the cerebellum & involved in sleep and arousal.
  + _Cerebellum_: Coordination and timing of voluntary movements, sense of equilibrium, language, attention ...

+ _Midbrain_: Eye movements, visual and auditory reflexes.

+ _Reticular Formation_: Modulates muscle reflexes, breathing & pain perception. Also regulates sleep, wakefulness & arousal.

+ _Thalamus_: "Relay station"  for all sensory info (except smell) to the cortex, regulates sleep/wakefulness.

+ _Hypothalamus_: Regulates basic needs _F_ighting, _F_leeing, _F_eeding, and _M_ating.

+ The _Cerebrum_: Involved in perception and motor control, cognitive functions, emotion, memory, and learning
  + _Cerebral cortex_: convoluted surface of cerebrum, about 1/8th of an inch thick. Approximately 30 billion neurons; each neuron makes about 10,000 synapses, approximately 300 trillion connections in total. Consists six layers of neurons, they have relatively uniform in structure.

A _synapse_ is a "connection" or junction between neurons, there are two types of synapse:

+ _Electrical_ synapses use _gap junctions_

+ _Chemical_ synapses use _neurotransmitters_

The Synapses Doctrine: Synapses are the basis for _memory_ and _learning_.


### Excitatory and Inhibitory

Synapses can be _excitatory_ or _inhibitory_. Excitatory synapses tend to increase postsynaptic membrane potential whereas inhibitory synapses tend to decrease postsynaptic membrane potential.

An _excitatory synapse_ works like this

> Input spike --> Neurotransmitter release (e.g. Glutamate) --> Binds to ion channel receptors -->
> Ion channel open --> \\(\text{Na}^{+}\\) influx --> Depolarization due to EPSP (excitatory postsynaptic potential)

And _inhibitory synapse_ works like this

> Input spike --> Neurotransmitter release (e.g. GABA) --> Binds to receptors --> Ion channel open -->
> \\(\text{K}^{+}\\) leaves cell --> Hyperpolarization due to IPSP (inhibitory postsynaptic potential)

### Synaptic Plasticity

Hebbian Plasticity:

> If neuron A repeatedly takes part in firing neuron B, then the synapse from A to B is strengthened.

+ Long Term Potentation (LSP): Experimentally observed increase in synaptic strength that lasts for hours or days.
+ Long Term Depression (LSD): Experimentally observed decrease in synaptic strength that lasts for hours or days.

Synaptic Plasticity depends on spike timing. LTP/LTD depends on _relative timing_ of input and output spikes:

+ LTP: Input spike before output spike
+ LTD: Input spike after output spike
